# eq8
Solving equations can feel confusing and laborious. I created this app so that students can get an intuitive feel for solving equations without all the painstaking attention to detail that is needed when writing out steps in an exam.

The app uses a HTML canvas to draw up a balance mat with draggable tiles. The tiles follow the rules of algebra such as simplification, collecting like terms, expanding and factorising brackets.

I wanted the app to be a starting point for students in their learning, with the knowledge that they would need to formalise their understanding with pen and paper later. With this in mind, the app writes each line of working (as the students will eventually have to do themselves) dynamically using calls to the MathJax javascript library.
